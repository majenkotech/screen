Description: Patch to make 4.2.1 compatible with Debian's 4.1.0 and
 4.2.0 packages 4.2.1 includes the Debian patches to extend the login
 name and $TERM length, but uses even larger values. This causes
 screen clients to no more be able to talk to older screen
 servers. See #644788 for a discussion of the same issue with earlier
 release combinations (4.1.0 vs 4.0.3).
 .
 For now this patch sets the mentioned values back to those which
 werew in use in Debian before (and seemed to be large enough for use
 in Debian).
